### SELF INTRO
Hello everyone<br>
I am Sidharth K and I am delighted to be here as an ECE studentjoining the Amfoss club. While my background is in ECE, I have always had a keen interest in coding and programming.

### WHY SHOULD YOU CHOSE ME?
I have an unwavering dedication and enthusiasm for coding and I enjoy sharing my knowledge to others, making me a valuable team member. I believe I can contribute meaningfully to the club.

### PLAN FOR NEXT SIX MONTHS
To be better at coding, building good skills and further honing my abilities.

### HOW WILL YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
I'll put my maximum effort in all the projects, which the club throw at me.
