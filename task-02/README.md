# MY PORTFOLIO WEBSITE
Hello and welcome to my Portfolio Website. This is a reflection of me and my passion. Whether you stumbled upon this page intentionally or by chance, I am excited to share with you my work.

## APPROACH
I referred youtube and got a basic understanding of hugo and how to build website using it's themes. I chosen Ananke theme from the list because I thought it would be good for making a portfolio website. Then I learned about github pages. I encountered a problem here, that is my site was showing correctly in the hugo local server and only its skeletal structure was showing in the github pages. So I have to redo it again and again until it was fixed. 

## About me
