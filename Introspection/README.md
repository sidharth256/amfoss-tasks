# INTROSPECTION

## WHY SHOULD YOU CHOSE ME?
I have an unwavering dedication and enthusiasm for coding and I enjoy sharing my knowledge to others, making me a valuable team member. I am passionate about coding and exploring new things in that field and I believe I can contribute meaningfully to the club.

## PLAN FOR NEXT SIX MONTHS
To be better at coding, building good skills and further honing my abilities. I will work hard and will try to become better version of myself. I'll also create my own project with the help of knowledge I earn from the club.

## HOW WILL YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
I'll put my maximum effort in all the projects, be active and I'll be ready for any thing which the club asks me and I'll be always there with the club. I'll push my limits to maximum extent to yield the output which the club wants from me.

## FEEDBACK ON SELECTION PROCESS
The selection process of the amfoss is very good. We are provided with opportunity to explore different languages in coding and create new projects in the form of praveshan tasks. It really helped me to learn a lot like creating website, making bots etc, although I couldn't complete some tasks as it seemed difficult to me. Still it was a wonderful experience attempting them and learning something new.
