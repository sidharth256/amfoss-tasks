# INTROSPECTION
## WHO AM I?
Hello everyone<br>
I am Sidharth K and I am delighted to be here as an ECE studentjoining the Amfoss club. While my background is in ECE, I have always had a keen interest in coding and programming.

## WHY SHOULD YOU CHOSE ME?
I have an unwavering dedication and enthusiasm for coding and I enjoy sharing my knowledge to others, making me a valuable team member. I am passionate about coding and exploring new things in that field and I believe I can contribute meaningfully to the club.

## PLAN FOR NEXT SIX MONTHS
To be better at coding, building good skills and further honing my abilities. I will work hard and will try to become better version of myself. I'll also create my own project with the help of knowledge I earn from the club.

## HOW WILL YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
I'll put my maximum effort in all the projects, be active and I'll be ready for any thing which the club asks me and I'll be always there when you need me.
